# Lambda//Void 🔮💻

*A stylish idle game where math meets cyberpunk.*

> ⚠️ **Prototype Warning:**  
> This game is in **active development**. What you’re playing now is a feature-rich prototype. Expect polish, balance tweaks, and new mechanics soon!

## 🧠 What’s This?

**Lambda//Void** is an incremental/idle web game about building abstract lambda calculus expressions and collapsing them to gain power.

Set inside a neon-drenched, digital void, you play as an operator trying to reconstruct reality through pure computation. It’s mathematical, mysterious — and surprisingly relaxing.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- **Tokens** let you generate lambda expressions  
- **Reduction steps** yield **Compute Cycles**, used for upgrades  
- Use **Compute Cycles** to:
  - Improve reduction speed  
  - Increase complexity of expressions  
  - Unlock passive token generation  
- **Reality Points** are gained by prestiging (Compiling Reality)  
- Convert **Reality Points into Qubits** to unlock **Quantum Lambda Functions**  
- Go deeper. Automate everything. Reach for the void.

## 🎓 Why Lambda Calculus?

Because it’s the secret skeleton of all functional programming — and it’s surprisingly fun to reduce.

The game simplifies it to an interactive experience, so even beginners can intuitively "play" with functional expressions.
