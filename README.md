# Lambda//Void

🧮💻 *An idle cyberpunk game about abstract math, functional programming, and bending the fabric of reality itself.*

---

### ❓ What is this?

**Lambda//Void** is a browser-based idle/incremental game where you generate and reduce mysterious expressions called **lambda functions** — the foundation of all functional programming languages. It’s part educational, part meditative, part digital rebellion.

You're inside a glowing cyberpunk system where pure computation manifests as expressions. Every reduction brings you closer to rewriting reality. It starts small — generate functions, simplify them, earn currency — but grows deeper with **automation, quantum upgrades, and prestige mechanics**.

### 🚀 Try It Out

Just open the game in any modern browser. No installs. No accounts.

Designed for a **960×600 window** to fit Newgrounds perfectly.

### 🕹️ Gameplay Summary

- 💾 Generate lambda expressions using tokens  
- 🔧 Reduce them step-by-step to gain compute cycles  
- 📈 Spend cycles on upgrades for faster automation and more complex functions  
- 🌀 Compile Reality (prestige) to earn **Reality Points**  
- ⚛️ Convert Reality Points into **Qubits** to unlock **Quantum Lambda Functions**  
- 🔁 Automate everything. Sit back. Watch the void work.

### 💡 Why Lambda Calculus?

Because it’s beautiful and weird.

Lambda calculus is the simplest, most powerful system of rules ever invented to define computation. It’s the blueprint for functional programming. In **Lambda//Void**, you don’t need to know the math — but you’ll *feel* the logic.
